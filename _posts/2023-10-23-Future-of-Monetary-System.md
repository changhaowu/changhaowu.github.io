Even in less developed regions like Kweichow, local governments have been able to issue substantial amounts of bonds, whose payment rely on the imaginery development, in securing funds for numerous meaningless, negative-return infrastructure projects.

Although the government can use a self-deceiving method to isolate the legal risks cummlated in city investment companies. 
In the long term, we shall estimate the price of the land based on the population in the future, that the lands like Kweichow with an expected net negative flow, the government may not be able to pay the bonds, and the projects may used to the virtual estate for the gnome in Kweichow? -->



Considering the total spending in a market is the aggregate of credit and money, we now have an analysis structure to present a simplified yet illustrative explanation of Mainland China's real estate market.

Over a decade-long surge in the real estate market, buyers have been gripped by a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO),
and this sentiment is further fueled by nationwide low interest rates prevailing over the decade.
This has led to a gradual inflation of credit within this sector, to such an extent that the market dynamics are now changing.
Following this line of reasoning, we validate the market from these two progressive levels.
I will first examine the buyers in the market, then move to the total expenditure that the buyers can provide in the market:

First, we esearch the buyer perspective; the game of real estate market has absorbed nearly all potential buyers into the market.
On validating my point, an analysis of economic activities in two distinct sectors is conducted:

- Private Sector: The housing market boom around 2015 extended its reach to smaller cities and rural areas. Under such circumstances, the pace of urbanization in China is likely to decelerate. The rapid pace of urbanization in China has been a major driver of soaring housing prices, as the families in the remote rural regions have been transitioned to the owners of the urban real estate. What's the next target buyers to the market? Imaginary buyers from Belt and Road countries, or is there another demographic yet to be tapped? Given the existing population holding housing assets in cities, we can assert that potential real estate buyers are expected to decrease.

- Government Sector: On the government sector, the local governments in China is not the direct buyers in the market, while they have motivation to apply the credit leverage to push the local land price to an irrational extent. Thus on the government sector, we merge the analysis to the next spending analysis part.

Upon the analysis of the existing buyers and sellers in the market, we then move to the total spending in the market, we still divide the spending in the market into spending from private sector and spending from the government sector.

- Private Sector: Just slightly remove the strange decorating motivation like "wedding house", "education house" from the real estate, the future spending from private sector can be induced to the confidence that the purchased asset can be more valubale, otherwise, most people shall rent the houses instead of purchasing the houses, using an irrational credit that they may regret for decades. What should be noticed is that we talk about confidence, not the condition. In a roaring market, most buyers can not the ideally rational individuals, they are poor illness with FOMO, most people only observe the world day by day, week by week.
  For sake of the convenience of analyzing, we attribute the valuble to the price of asset, measured in the official currency in the nation. As we analyze, the amount of buyers in the total market has been exhausted, the remaining individuals from private sectors, they are in a state of superposition of both buyer and seller. 
  Given an balanced ratio of buyer and seller in the total market, the other dynamics for rushing-in spending in the market rely on the holistic exchange process, that I refer huge amounts of individuals who hold the worse asset have the motivation to exchange for the better asset. From the holisitc market, the exchange shall rely on the economics development shared to most of the buyers in the market, whose dynamics rely on the rapid productivity increase in the market. While you see, as the China participating in the WTO for more than two decades, 

- Government Sector: Another segment in the market is the government sectors in China; we shall fully realize the competitive relationships between local governments, as one of the ”KPIs“ for local government is the urbanization progress. Based on the assumption of their competitive relationship, the local governments spread in China, are "reasonable" to apply the credit leverage to push the local land price to an irrational extent.
Even in less developed regions like Guizhou, local governments have been able to issue substantial amounts of bonds, whose repayments rely on imaginatively planned development, in securing funds for numerous ill-conceived, negative-return infrastructure projects.
This trend echoes the Japanese asset price bubble, reminding me of scenes from "Spirited Away," which depicts abandoned resorts and filled natural rivers in remote regions of Japan. Although the government can use a elf-deceptive method to isolate themselves from the legal risks accumulated in city investment companies.
While the long term, we shall estimate the price of the land based on the population in the future; in regions like Guizhou with an expected net negative population flow, the government may not be able to pay the bonds, and the projects may be used to create the virtual estate for the gnome in Guizhou?
