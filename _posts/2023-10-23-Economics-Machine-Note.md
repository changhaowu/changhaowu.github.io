In this blog post, I'll share my reading notes on Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works." As someone who's relatively new to economics, I'm deeply grateful to Dalio for his generosity in sharing his profound insights on the mechanics of economics. His work has significantly broadened my understanding of the subject.

Dalio introduces a foundational concept that diverges from classical economics. He frames the modern credit monetary-based economy through what he terms the "Transaction-Based Approach." Through this lens, we can view the economy as a cumulative result of individual transactions.

At the core of economics lies the transaction, which involves two primary entities: a buyer, who offers cash and credit, and a seller, who provides a certain quality of goods. Moving up in complexity, a specific market represents the aggregated transactions related to a particular good. Expanding this notion further, our global economy is essentially the sum of all such markets for every conceivable good. This approach allows us to identify and trace what might be considered 'eigen'-transactions within a market. These transactions tend to be more rational and deliberate, helping us in understanding the individual markets and, by extension, the broader economy.

<!-- This blogpost is a reading note for the Ray Dalio's How the Economics Machine Works, thanks for his generousness on sharing his insight on Economics Machines, I really learn a lot from his book. His first basis concept is that, he define the modern credit monetary based econonmy a new measure, compared to the   classical economics, he define his measure as "Transaction-Based Approach", in his transaction-based len on the economics, we can observe the economics as the add-up from the transcations.From the fundemental element of the economics, the transaction is establish on a duo-group, <(a buyer, cash+credit),    (a seller. sold quality)>, get higher, a specifc market is the sum of the transactions on the certain good, and our living world economy is the sum of the markets on all goods in the world. Due to this split principle, we can relatively easily track the 'Eigen'-transaction in the market, they tend to be more rational, which help us understand the market, then the whole economy. -->

- In the transaction-based perspective, the asset's price is determined by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy, it's easy to boost spending in transactions.
- Except categorizing the all markets on the trading qualities, we can also attribute the transactions based on the buyers. The buyers can come from:
  - The private sector: This can be further divided into households and businesses, both domestic and foreign.
  - The government sector: Using the US as an example, the federal government spends money on goods and services. Meanwhile, the central bank has the ability to create money and spend it on financial assets.

In a transaction-based economy, one effective approach to understanding market dynamics is by examining 'eigen-transactions', or representative transactions. Given this opinion, we can interpret the reason for some irrational strategy in the principle of tranditional supply-demand relationship 1) the government sector, such as FED create unusual amount of money during the early phase of COVID-19. 2) Concurrently, the private sector sometimes engaged in seemingly irrational transactions when viewed in the context of current circumstances. The irrational transaction can either be a support from frozen economy or the fuel to an extraordinary bubble.

Another significant aspect highlighted by the transaction-based perspective is the concept of credit creation. When analyzing GDP statistics, some experts propose the concept of 'velocity of money' can account for how a GDP is sustained even with a relatively smaller money supply in the market. However, Dalio posits that overlooked counterpart of the gap is filled by credit formulation in the economy or, in more specific terms, the existence of sub-markets within the broader economic framework.

<!-- Considering the total spending in a market is the aggregation of credit formulation and money, we now have an analysis strucuture to present a simplified yet illustrative explanation of Mainland China's real estate market.  -->

<!-- Over a decades-long surge in real estate market, buyers have been gripped by a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), 
and the sentiment further fueled by a decades-long nationwide low interest rates. 
This has led to a gradual inflation of credit within this sector, to an extent that the game will turn down now. 
Alongside this chain of induction, we validate the market from these two progressive levels, 
I will first examine the buyers in the markete, as move to the total expenditure that the buyers can provide in the market: -->

<!-- First, we research on the buyer perspective, the game of real estate market have absorb nearly all potential buyers into the market. On proving my point, an analysis of economic activities in two distinct sectors is conducted: -->

<!-- - Private Sector: The housing market boom around 2015 extended its reach to smaller cities and rural areas. Under such circumstances, the pace of urbanization in China is likely to decelerate. The unusual urbanization pace in China is main push hand of the roaring housing price, as the family in the remote rural regions have been converted to the owner of the urban real estate. What's the next target, the imaginary buyers that from from the Belt and Road countries or the ancestors that have been buried in lands? Given the existing influx housing-holding population in cities, we can asset that potential real estate buyers, is expected to decrease. -->

<!-- - Government Sector: Another buyer sector in the market is the government sectors in China, we shall fully realize the competitive relationships between local governements, as the one of the ”KPIs“ for local government is the urbanization progress. Based on the assumption of their competitive relationship, the local governments spreading in China, are "reasonable" to apply the credit leverage to push the local land price into an irrational extent. 
Even in less developed regions like Kweichow, local governments have been able to issue substantial amounts of bonds, whose payment rely on the imaginery development, in securing funds for numerous meaningless, negative-return infrastructure projects.
This trend echoes the Japanese asset price bubble, reminds me of scenes from "Spirited Away," which depicts abandoned resorts and filled natural rivers in remote regions of Japan. Although the government can use a self-deceiving method to isolate the legal risks cummlated in city investment companies. 
In the long term, we shall estimate the price of the land based on the population in the future, that the lands like Kweichow with an expected net negative flow, the government may not be able to pay the bonds, and the projects may used to the virtual estate for the gnome in Kweichow? -->

Considering the total spending in a market is the aggregate of credit and money, we now have an analysis structure to present a simplified yet illustrative explanation of Mainland China's real estate market.

Over a decade-long surge in the real estate market, buyers have been gripped by a Fear of Missing Out (FOMO),
and this sentiment is further fueled by nationwide low interest rates prevailing over the decade.
This has led to a gradual inflation of credit within this sector, to such an extent that the market dynamics are now changing.
Following this line of reasoning, we validate the market from these two progressive levels.
I will first examine the buyers in the market, then move to the total expenditure that the buyers can provide in the market:

First, we esearch the buyer perspective; the game of real estate market has absorbed nearly all potential buyers into the market.
On validating my point, an analysis of economic activities in two distinct sectors is conducted:

- Private Sector: The housing market boom around 2015 extended its reach to smaller cities and rural areas. Under such circumstances, the pace of urbanization in China is likely to decelerate. The rapid pace of urbanization in China has been a major driver of soaring housing prices, as the families in the remote rural regions have been transitioned to the owners of the urban real estate. What's the next target buyers to the market? Imaginary buyers from Belt and Road countries, or is there another demographic yet to be tapped? Given the existing population holding housing assets in cities, we can assert that potential real estate buyers are expected to decrease.

- Government Sector: On the government sector, the local governments in China is not the direct buyers in the market, while they have motivation to apply the credit leverage to push the local land price to an irrational extent. Thus on the government sector, we merge the analysis to the next spending analysis part.

Upon the analysis of the existing buyers and sellers in the market, we then move to the total spending in the market, we still divide the spending in the market into spending from private sector and spending from the government sector.

- Private Sector: Just slightly remove the strange decorating motivation like "wedding house", "education house" from the real estate, the future spending from private sector can be induced to the confidence that the purchased asset can be more valubale, otherwise, most people shall rent the houses instead of purchasing the houses, using an irrational credit that they may regret for decades. What should be noticed is that we talk about confidence, not the condition. In a roaring market, most buyers can not the ideally rational individuals, they are poor illness with FOMO, most people only observe the world day by day, week by week.
  For sake of the convenience of analyzing, we attribute the valuble to the price of asset, measured in the official currency in the nation. As we analyze, the amount of buyers in the total market has been exhausted, the remaining individuals from private sectors, they are in a state of superposition of both buyer and seller. 
  Given an balanced ratio of buyer and seller in the total market, the other dynamics for rushing-in spending in the market rely on the holistic exchange process, that I refer huge amounts of individuals who hold the worse asset have the motivation to exchange for the better asset. From the holisitc market, the exchange shall rely on the economics development shared to most of the buyers in the market, whose dynamics rely on the rapid productivity increase in the market. While you see, as the China participating in the WTO for more than two decades, 

- Government Sector: Another segment in the market is the government sectors in China; we shall fully realize the competitive relationships between local governments, as one of the ”KPIs“ for local government is the urbanization progress. Based on the assumption of their competitive relationship, the local governments spread in China, are "reasonable" to apply the credit leverage to push the local land price to an irrational extent.
Even in less developed regions like Guizhou, local governments have been able to issue substantial amounts of bonds, whose repayments rely on imaginatively planned development, in securing funds for numerous ill-conceived, negative-return infrastructure projects.
This trend echoes the Japanese asset price bubble, reminding me of scenes from "Spirited Away," which depicts abandoned resorts and filled natural rivers in remote regions of Japan. Although the government can use a elf-deceptive method to isolate themselves from the legal risks accumulated in city investment companies.
While the long term, we shall estimate the price of the land based on the population in the future; in regions like Guizhou with an expected net negative population flow, the government may not be able to pay the bonds, and the projects may be used to create the virtual estate for the gnome in Guizhou?

<!-- Given the transacation-based economony, we can analyze the economony from the eigen-transaction in the market, the government sector may create money despite supply-demand relationship in aiding economony in early phase of COVID-19. The private sector can also do some irrational transaction, if we observe their behavior in the current state. -->

<!-- Another transacation-based measure brings is the credit formulation. In satistics of GDP, some argues that the velocity of moneys can explain the reason why GDP can be paid given smaller amount of money in market. While Dalio the missing counterpart is actually the credit in the economics, or the submarket in economics. -->

<!-- An example that not so accurate, but I really want to propose an explanation is the Chinese mainland real estate market, given the decade-long real estate boom, the credit in the real estate market accounts increase to a too high level, cause the next generation of buyers in the market can't afford the price, which leads to self-reinforcement cycle in the market crash down. The inflection point cause two problems: the surpass the credit formulation speed,  -->

<!-- On proving my point, we observe the economics in two sectors: 
Government sector: the government in the poorest region like Kweichow, can also publish sea amount bonds, lend money to build a lot of meaningless infrastructure projects. The phonomemon really remind me the bubble times in Japan, the film “Spirited Away” also reveal the abondoned resort and and the filled natural rivers in many remote regions in Japan. 
from the private sector: we can observe the housing market boom in 2015 spread to small cities and rural areas. Under this condition, the urbanalization in China will not be able to proceed in a high speed. The population into the cities, or the buyers to the real estate will start to decrease.  -->
