# How the Economic Machine Works

In this blog post, I'll share my reading notes on Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works." As someone who's relatively new to economics, I'm deeply grateful to Dalio for his generosity in sharing his profound insights on the mechanics of economics. His work has significantly broadened my understanding of the subject.

## The Transaction-Based Measure on Economic Machine

Dalio introduces a foundational concept that diverges from classical economics. He depicts the modern credit monetary-based economy through what he terms the "Transaction-Based Approach." Through this lens, we can view the economy as a cumulative result of individual transactions.

At the core of economics lies the transaction, which involves two primary entities:

- a buyer, who brings both money and credit to the market
- a seller, who provides a particular good or financial assets. 

Moving up in complexity, a specific market represents the aggregated transactions related to a particular good. Broadening this idea, our global economy is essentially the sum of all such markets for every conceivable good. 

Apart from categorizing all the markets on their trading qualities, we can also classify the transactions based on the buyers. The buyers can originate from:

- The private sector: Further broken down into households and businesses, both domestic and foreign.
- The government sector: Illustrated by the US, the federal government allocates money to domestic goods and services, while the central bank has the capability to create money and primarily invest in financial assets.
<!-- Using the US as an example, the federal government spends money on domestic goods and services. Meanwhile, the central bank has the ability to create money and spend mostly on financial assets. -->

In the transaction-based perspective, assuming a stable supply of the asset quantity, which shows short-term fluctuation, the asset's price is influenced by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy, it's easy to adjust the supply of spending in the market.

After delving into the concept of the Transaction-Based Lens as posited by Ray Dalio, I aim to briefly outline three key takeaways from the measure on economics, explaining their significance in understanding economic dynamics:

1. Understanding Market Dynamics through 'Eigen-Transactions'

  In a transaction-based economy, one effective approach to dissecting market dynamics is by examining 'eigen-transactions', or representative transactions. This viewpoint allows us to interpret the reason for some irrational while deliberate strategies in the principle of traditional supply-demand relationship,two notable instances include:

  - The governmental sector, exemplified by the FED, which created an unusual amount of money during the early phase of COVID-19.
  - Simultaneously, the private sector occasionally engaged in what appeared to be irrational transactions, the individuals prefer the confidence to condition, to judging the future price of the asset

  Given the prevailing circumstances. Such transactions can either bolster a stagnant economy or fuel an extraordinary bubble.

2. The Role of 'Credit Creation' in Bridging Monetary Gaps

  Another pivotal aspect underscored by the transaction-based perspective is the concept of "credit creation". When analyzing GDP statistics, some experts propose the concept of 'velocity of money' can account for how a GDP is sustained even with a relatively smaller money supply in the market. However, Dalio argues that the overlooked component bridging the gap between GDP and existing money is the formulation of credit within the economy. Interestingly, even if a market experiences an increase in money supply, a significant decline in formulated credit can still lead to price deflation.

3. Market-Participatory Creation of Financial Assets

  Contrary to the unique authority of the central bank, which creates money out of thin air, the creation of financial assets can be a more market-participatory action.From the standpoint of capital providers, purchasing financial assets is possessing adequate capital and entering into contracts with productive individuals in the economy, then expecting higher future returns. Conversely, from the borrowers' viewpoint, they are the active producers in the market, confident that they can earn more in the future. Thus, they exchange some of their future earnings for current capital, used to enlarge their production of goods.
  The creation of a financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, emerges not from institutional authority but from pure market behavior.

<!-- Conversely, from the borrowers' viewpoint, producing financial assets entails exchanging some future earnings for current capital, which is utilized to boost goods production.  -->
<!-- The purchases of finanical asset, is from the viewpoint of capatial providers, they have adequate capitals, they make a contract with the productive individuals in economics, in exchange of the excessiv return in the future.
The production of financial asset, vice versa, is from the viewpoint of borrowers, they are the active producers in the market, they trust themselves can earn more in the future, thus they sell some of their future reward for the current money used to enlarge their production of goods. 
The creation of financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, just from the thin air, a pure market behavior.-->

## The Template: Three Fundemental Forces in Economic

<!-- this combination and permutation, we shall make a table, reference to evergrande, it will be more clear -->'
Viewing the economic machine in the long run, take US as an example, 

In the economic machine, we can stimulate the supply of spending by using some fiscal methods, especially by enlarging the credit spent in the market. Meanwhile, the production of good and finanicial asset can be deferred from the spending, the latency between fluent spending and assets production cause cycles in economic. Focusing on the financial asset, why the credit promised in the previous moment is larger than the the actual pay-back ablitity in the market.
Dalio classify the debt cycle into two types, the short-term cycle and the long-term cycle: 

- Short-term debt cycle:
