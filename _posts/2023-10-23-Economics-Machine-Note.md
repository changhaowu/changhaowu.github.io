# How the Economic Machine Works

In this blog post, I'll share my reading notes on Ray Dalio's "How the Economic Machine Works." As someone who's relatively new to economics, I'm deeply grateful to Dalio for his generosity in sharing his profound insights on the mechanics of economics. His work has significantly broadened my understanding of the subject.

## The Transaction-Based Measure on Economic Machine

Dalio introduces a foundational concept that diverges from classical economics. He frames the modern credit monetary-based economy through what he terms the "Transaction-Based Approach." Through this lens, we can view the economy as a cumulative result of individual transactions.

At the core of economics lies the transaction, which involves two primary entities: a buyer, who offers cash and credit, and a seller, who provides a certain quality of goods. Moving up in complexity, a specific market represents the aggregated transactions related to a particular good. Expanding this notion further, our global economy is essentially the sum of all such markets for every conceivable good. This approach allows us to identify and trace what might be considered 'eigen'-transactions within a market. These transactions tend to be more rational and deliberate, helping us in understanding the individual markets and, by extension, the broader economy.

- In the transaction-based perspective, the asset's price is determined by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy, it's easy to boost spending in transactions.
- Except categorizing the all markets on the trading qualities, we can also attribute the transactions based on the buyers. The buyers can come from:
  - The private sector: This can be further divided into households and businesses, both domestic and foreign.
  - The government sector: Using the US as an example, the federal government spends money on goods and services. Meanwhile, the central bank has the ability to create money and spend it on financial assets.

In a transaction-based economy, one effective approach to understanding market dynamics is by examining 'eigen-transactions', or representative transactions. Given this opinion, we can interpret the reason for some irrational strategy in the principle of tranditional supply-demand relationship 1) the government sector, such as FED create unusual amount of money during the early phase of COVID-19. 2) Concurrently, the private sector sometimes engaged in seemingly irrational transactions when viewed in the context of current circumstances. The irrational transaction can either be a support from frozen economy or the fuel to an extraordinary bubble.

Another significant aspect highlighted by the transaction-based perspective is the concept of credit creation. When analyzing GDP statistics, some experts propose the concept of 'velocity of money' can account for how a GDP is sustained even with a relatively smaller money supply in the market. However, Dalio posits that overlooked counterpart of the gap is filled by credit formulation in the economy or, in more specific terms, the existence of sub-markets within the broader economic framework.
