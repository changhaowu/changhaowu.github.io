<h1 id="how-the-economic-machine-works">How the Economic Machine Works</h1>

<p>In this blog post, I’ll share my reading notes on Ray Dalio’s “How the Economic Machine Works.” As someone who’s relatively new to economics, I’m deeply grateful to Dalio for his generosity in sharing his profound insights on the mechanics of economics. His work has significantly broadened my understanding of the subject.</p>

<h2 id="the-transaction-based-measure-on-economic-machine">The Transaction-Based Measure on Economic Machine</h2>

<p>Dalio introduces a foundational concept that diverges from classical economics. He depicts the modern credit monetary-based economy through what he terms the “Transaction-Based Approach.” Through this lens, we can view the economy as a cumulative result of individual transactions.</p>

<p>At the core of economics lies the transaction, which involves two primary entities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a buyer, who brings both money and credit to the market</li>
  <li>a seller, who provides a particular good or financial assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving up in complexity, a specific market represents the aggregated transactions related to a particular good. Broadening this idea, our global economy is essentially the sum of all such markets for every conceivable good.</p>

<p>Apart from categorizing all the markets on their trading qualities, we can also classify the transactions based on the buyers. The buyers can originate from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The private sector: Further broken down into households and businesses, both domestic and foreign.</li>
  <li>The government sector: Illustrated by the US, the federal government allocates money to domestic goods and services, while the central bank has the capability to create money and primarily invest in financial assets.
<!-- Using the US as an example, the federal government spends money on domestic goods and services. Meanwhile, the central bank has the ability to create money and spend mostly on financial assets. --></li>
</ul>

<p>In the transaction-based perspective, assuming a stable supply of the asset quantity, which shows short-term fluctuation, the asset’s price is influenced by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy, it’s easy to adjust the supply of spending in the market.
<!-- In the transaction-based perspective, fixing supply of the asset quantity, which shows short-term fluctuation, the asset's price is determined by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy,  it's easy to adjust supply of spending in transactions market. --></p>

<p>After delving into the concept of the Transaction-Based Lens as posited by Ray Dalio, I aim to briefly outline three key takeaways from the measure on economics, explaining their significance in understanding economic dynamics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding Market Dynamics through ‘Eigen-Transactions’</p>

    <p>In a transaction-based economy, one effective approach to dissecting market dynamics is by examining ‘eigen-transactions’, or representative transactions. This viewpoint allows us to interpret the reason for some irrational while deliberate strategies in the principle of traditional supply-demand relationship,two notable instances include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The governmental sector, exemplified by the FED, which created an unusual amount of money during the early phase of COVID-19.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, the private sector occasionally engaged in what appeared to be irrational transactions, the individuals prefer the confidence to condition, to judging the future price of the asset</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given the prevailing circumstances. Such transactions can either ignite a depression economy or fuel an extraordinary bubble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Role of ‘Credit Creation’ in Bridging Monetary Gaps</p>

    <p>Another pivotal aspect underscored by the transaction-based perspective is the concept of ‘credit creation’. When analyzing GDP statistics, some experts propose the concept of ‘velocity of money’ can account for how a GDP is sustained even with a relatively smaller money supply in the market. However, Dalio argues that the overlooked component bridging the gap between GDP and existing money is the formulation of credit within the economy. Interestingly, even if a market experiences an increase in money supply, a significant decline in formulated credit can still lead to price deflation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Market-Participatory Creation of Financial Assets</p>

    <p>Contrary to the unique authority of the central bank, which creates money out of thin air, the creation of financial assets can be a more market-participatory action. From the standpoint of borrowers, purchasing financial assets is possessing adequate capital and entering into contracts with productive individuals in the economy, then expecting higher future returns. Conversely, from the debtors’ viewpoint, they are the active producers in the market, confident that they can earn more in the future. Thus, they exchange some of their future earnings for current capital, used to enlarge their production of goods.
 The creation of a financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, emerges not from institutional authority but from pure market behavior.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Conversely, from the borrowers' viewpoint, producing financial assets entails exchanging some future earnings for current capital, which is utilized to boost goods production.  -->
<!-- The purchases of finanical asset, is from the viewpoint of capatial providers, they have adequate capitals, they make a contract with the productive individuals in economics, in exchange of the excessiv return in the future.
The production of financial asset, vice versa, is from the viewpoint of borrowers, they are the active producers in the market, they trust themselves can earn more in the future, thus they sell some of their future reward for the current money used to enlarge their production of goods. 
The creation of financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, just from the thin air, a pure market behavior.-->

<!-- while Dalio set up a easy-using three basises for the economics mechanism, these three basis can roughly approx the working of the economics: -->
<p>Dalio provides an easy-to-grasp framework with three basis for understanding the economic mechanism. These three bases can roughly understand the workings of the economy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Productivity Growth</li>
  <li>Two Debt Cycles:
    <ul>
      <li>Long-term Debt Cycle</li>
      <li>Short-term Debt Cycle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="productivity-growth">Productivity Growth</h3>

<!-- In the long run, the intrinsic driving is fueled by the producitivity growth, the reason is simple, even on a modern economics system with credit, the formed credit needed to pay-back in the future. While the development of science and technology will not easily erased from the world. From the viewpoint of the whole economics machine,  With the growth of producitivity, the capital formation in the past will easily payback in the future. 
Taking the history of US as an example, the image shows the GDP per capita adjusted for the inflation, from the illustration, we find the growth of producitivity is relatively a steady process. Besides the Great Depression period, the economics machine crash down: -->

<!-- In the long run, the intrinsic drive is fueled by productivity growth. The reason is simple: even in a modern economic system with credit, the created credit needs to be repaid in the future, on contrary, the advancements in science and technology will not be forced to erase from the world. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the macro economic machine, with the growth of productivity, the capital invested in the past will more easily be repaid in the future. -->

<p>In the long run, the intrinsic drive is fueled by productivity growth. The reasoning is straightforward: even in a modern economic system with credit, the generated credit needs to be repaid in the future. In contrast, the advancements in science and technology are enduring assets that will not be erased from the world. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the macro-economic machine, with the growth of productivity, the capital invested in the past will be repaid more easily in the future.</p>

<p>Taking the history of the US as an example, the image below shows the GDP per capita adjusted for inflation. From the data, we observe that the growth of productivity is relatively a steady process. Aside from the Great Depression period, economic downturns are less pronounced:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Real_GDP_per_Capita.png" alt="Real_GDP_per_Capita" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>

<p>Productivity growth, as depicted in the domestic market of the US, presents a macro-level perspective. Although individuals may have faced greater challenges during the Great Depression, thanks to the diligent work of the author of the diagram, we can compare the stock prices, which are relevant to individual people:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Producitivity-credit_equity.png" alt="Producitivity-credit_equity" style="zoom:88%;" /></p>

<p>Even when adjusted on a log-scale, the equity asset price experiences severe volatility, compared to the macro productivity measure: the GDP per capita in the market. Yet, the equity asset price clearly holds a strong relevance to the ordinary person in the economics machine. The question arises: during the Great Depression, did people suddenly forget the methods of productivity,  or did the symbols of productivity growth, these machines, suddenly revert to versions from decades prior? In analyzing this issue, we should consider another fundamental force in the economic machine: the two debt cycles.</p>

<h3 id="the-two-debt-cycles">The Two Debt Cycles</h3>

<!-- The debt cycles arise from the credit in the economics, if we observe the human society as a holistic entity, we find the economics cycles are repetitous patterns.  -->
<p>Debt cycles emerge from the use of credit in economics. When we observe human society as a holistic entity, we notice that economic cycles are repetitive patterns in history.</p>

<p>To illustrate the patterns do exist, Dalio uses Monopoly as an approximation to the real-world economic machine. This is due to the design of Monopoly: in the early stage of the game, ‘property is king’. As cash in the market decreases, the game enters the second stage where ‘money is king’. Furthermore, with the virtual introduction of a ‘bank’, which offers money with a deposit rate reward, and lends money to potential debtors, there will lead to the game to an interesting stage, where the borrowers squeeze the bank’s deposit while the debtors fail to pay back, symbolizing a debt crisis in the Monopoly game.</p>

<!-- Monopoly with the clear rules, written in the reference books. For the real-world ecnomics machines, what we need is to extract some signs and rules. Under the transaction-based measure, we can re-define the propersity and depression, then the money and credit, to compose the monetary system. -->
<p>Monopoly, with its clear rules written in the reference books, serves as a simplified model. For the real-world economic machines, our task is to extract some signs and rules. Under the transaction-based measure, we can redefine prosperity and depression, then examine money and credit to understand the monetary system.</p>

<h4 id="modern-monetary-system-through-the-transaction-based-measure">Modern Monetary System Through the transaction-Based Measure</h4>

<!-- The two fundemental element in modern monetary is money and credit. For sake of flexibility of fiscal policy, the government abondon the previous commodity element, compared to previous monetary system -->
<p>The two fundamental elements in modern monetary systems are money and credit. For the sake of fiscal policy flexibility, the government shifted from the previous monetary system, which abandoned the previous commodity element, such as gold.</p>

<h5 id="money">Money</h5>

<!-- In Transaction-Based approach, the money is one way to settle the transaction. Compared to the credit, which gradual settle the payment in future time, money is the payment in current timestamp. Besides, Dalio seperate the total spending in US economy in transaction-based measure, the money, which stands for the currency and reserves in existence only about `$` 3 trillion, while the credit is about `$` 50 trillion, 15 times more than the money, that is to say that: -->

<p>In the Transaction-Based approach, money is a means to settle transactions. Compared to credit, which gradually settles payments in the future, money facilitates payment in the current timestamp. Besides, Dalio separates the total spending in the US economy into two categories in the transaction-based measure: money, which stands for the currency and reserves in existence totals about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 3 trillion, while credit amounts to about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 50 trillion, 15 times more than the money. This implies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many people actually pay with credit when they settle their transaction</li>
  <li>During a debt crisis, many people may discover their payment ability is less than the obligations of credit payment.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="credit">Credit</h5>

<p>Aside from the money that printed by the central bank, individuals in the economics machine will also use capital formation to create the credit, seemingly out of thin air. 
The borrowers and the debtors, enter a contract to repay at  future time, the formed credit can be spent in the market, with no difference to the money.</p>

<p>In an ideal process, the borrowers enlarge their productivity in a pace that faster than the conventional payback rate.
The debtor can have the excession gap between debtor’s producivity and the payback rate. And the borrowers, tend to appoint a payback rate in contract that faster than the productivity growth rate of the whole market.</p>

<p>We can delve deeper into the ideal process, Dalio use a simple example about a whitewasher in his notes. But I want to rewrite his story, with not missing the essence:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dalio invite the whitewasher to paint his office, and make a paper contract. Remember, wow, the famous Dalio.</li>
  <li>The whitewasher actually have no adequate money to buy the materials, but he show the bank his contract. The manager of the bank, who is a friend of Dalio, lend the whitewasher the money.</li>
  <li>With the money, the whitewasher go to the building materials saleman, instead of buy the materials with the full money, he pay in a plan, partially money, the residual in a contract to pay in the future.</li>
  <li>Finally, the whitewasher finish the task in an excellent outcome, everyone in Bridgewater admire Dalio’s new office. So the whitewasher get many contracts from the Bridgewater’s employees. 
Remember, he bought the materials in credit, so he can rush to the materials saleman, buy a large amount of materials to prepare the offices painting contracts in Bridgewaters.</li>
  <li>The story go to the end? Nope, remember the bank manager and the salesman, the bank manager can merge the credit of the whitewasher(A++ rank), into a asset package, sells in the debt market.
And the material salemans, he find a steady buyer of the materials, which make him confident to make a better futures contract with his material manufacturers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The money paid in the ideal process is fewer than the credit, but individual in every chain of the process are pleased with the outcome. The whitewasher get the money, the bank manager get the interest, the material salesman get the money, the material manufacturer get the money, Dalio get the new office. This is the power of credit, it helps the creation demand alleviated from the burden of the commdity or money in previous mmonetary system. The creation of credit solely depends on the confidence of borrowers and debtors in the market. It indeed accelerate the positive producivity process.
With the ideal process spreading the whole market, the market is in a self-reinforced prosperity state.</p>

<p>While if you notice the news about real estate deleveraging in China, you can smartly assign the respective characters in China real estate market to the characters in previous story, the abuse of the credit can incur the disasters. The heavy burdens in the private downturn the economics development.</p>
