<h1 id="how-the-economic-machine-works">How the Economic Machine Works</h1>

<p>In this blog post, I‚Äôll share my reading notes on Ray Dalio‚Äôs ‚ÄòHow the Economic Machine Works‚Äô As someone who‚Äôs relatively new to economics, I‚Äôm deeply grateful to Dalio for his generosity in sharing his profound insights on the mechanics of economics. His work has significantly broadened my understanding of the subject.</p>

<h2 id="the-transaction-based-measure-on-economic-machine">The Transaction-Based Measure on Economic Machine</h2>

<p>Dalio introduces a foundational concept that diverges from classical economics. He depicts the modern credit monetary-based economy through what he terms the ‚ÄúTransaction-Based Approach.‚Äù Through this lens, we can view the economy as a cumulative result of individual transactions.</p>

<p>At the core of economics lies the transaction, which involves two primary entities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a buyer, who brings both money and credit to the market</li>
  <li>a seller, who provides a particular good or financial assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving up in complexity, a specific market represents the aggregated transactions related to a particular good. Broadening this idea, our global economy is essentially the sum of all such markets for every conceivable good.</p>

<p>Apart from categorizing all the markets on their trading qualities, we can also classify the transactions based on the buyers. The buyers can originate from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The private sector: Further broken down into households and businesses, both domestic and foreign.</li>
  <li>The government sector: Illustrated by the US, the federal government allocates money to domestic goods and services, while the central bank has the capability to create money and primarily invest in financial assets.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the transaction-based perspective, assuming a stable supply of the asset quantity, which shows short-term fluctuation, the asset‚Äôs price is influenced by both the money and credit expended on it. Given our modern credit-based economy, it‚Äôs easy to adjust the supply of spending in the market.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Transaction_based_economics.png" alt="Transport_Map_Visualization" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

<p>After delving into the concept of the Transaction-Based Lens as posited by Ray Dalio, I aim to briefly outline three key takeaways from the measure on economics, explaining their significance in understanding economic dynamics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Understanding Market Dynamics through ‚ÄòEigen-Transactions‚Äô</p>

    <p>In a transaction-based economy, one effective approach to dissecting market dynamics is by examining ‚Äòeigen-transactions‚Äô, or representative transactions. This viewpoint allows us to interpret the reason for some irrational while deliberate strategies in the principle of traditional supply-demand relationship,two notable instances include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The governmental sector, exemplified by the FED, which created an unusual amount of money during the early phase of COVID-19.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, the private sector occasionally engaged in what appeared to be irrational transactions, the individuals prefer the confidence to condition, to judging the future price of the asset</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given the prevailing circumstances. Such transactions can either ignite a depression economy or fuel an extraordinary bubble.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Role of ‚ÄòCredit Creation‚Äô in Bridging Monetary Gaps</p>

    <p>Another pivotal aspect underscored by the transaction-based perspective is the concept of ‚Äòcredit creation‚Äô. When analyzing GDP statistics, some experts propose the concept of ‚Äòvelocity of money‚Äô can account for how a GDP is sustained even with a relatively smaller money supply in the market. However, Dalio argues that the overlooked component bridging the gap between GDP and existing money is the formulation of credit within the economy. Interestingly, even if a market experiences an increase in money supply, a significant decline in formulated credit can still lead to price deflation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Market-Participatory Creation of Financial Assets</p>

    <p>Contrary to the unique authority of the central bank, which creates money out of thin air, the creation of financial assets can be a more market-participatory action. From the standpoint of borrowers, purchasing financial assets is possessing adequate capital and entering into contracts with productive individuals in the economy, then expecting higher future returns. Conversely, from the debtors‚Äô viewpoint, they are the active producers in the market, confident that they can earn more in the future. Thus, they exchange some of their future earnings for current capital, used to enlarge their production of goods.
 The creation of a financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, emerges not from institutional authority but from pure market behavior.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Conversely, from the borrowers' viewpoint, producing financial assets entails exchanging some future earnings for current capital, which is utilized to boost goods production.  -->
<!-- The purchases of finanical asset, is from the viewpoint of capatial providers, they have adequate capitals, they make a contract with the productive individuals in economics, in exchange of the excessiv return in the future.
The production of financial asset, vice versa, is from the viewpoint of borrowers, they are the active producers in the market, they trust themselves can earn more in the future, thus they sell some of their future reward for the current money used to enlarge their production of goods. 
The creation of financial asset, that can affect the amount of credit in the market, just from the thin air, a pure market behavior.-->

<h2 id="the-template-three-fundemental-forces-in-economic">The Template: Three Fundemental Forces in Economic</h2>

<!-- this combination and permutation, we shall make a table, reference to evergrande, it will be more clear -->
<p>Exploring the working mechanism of economic machines, please envision the Fourier decomposition:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Fourier Decomposition+Fundemental_Force.png" alt="Fourier Decomposition+Fundemental_Force" style="zoom:36%;" /></p>

<!-- while Dalio set up a easy-using three basises for the economics mechanism, these three basis can roughly approx the working of the economics: -->
<p>Dalio provides an easy-to-grasp framework with three basis for understanding the economic mechanism. These three bases can roughly understand the workings of the economy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Productivity Growth</li>
  <li>Two Debt Cycles:
    <ul>
      <li>Long-term Debt Cycle</li>
      <li>Short-term Debt Cycle</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="productivity-growth">Productivity Growth</h3>

<p>In the long run, the intrinsic drive is fueled by productivity growth. The reasoning is straightforward: even in a modern economic system with credit, the generated credit needs to be repaid in the future. In contrast, the advancements in science and technology are enduring assets that will not be erased from the world. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the macro-economic machine, with the growth of productivity, the capital invested in the past will be repaid more easily in the future.</p>

<p>Taking the history of the US as an example, the image below shows the GDP per capita adjusted for inflation. From the data, we observe that the growth of productivity is relatively a steady process. Aside from the Great Depression period, economic downturns are less pronounced:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Real_GDP_per_Capita.png" alt="Real_GDP_per_Capita" style="zoom:28%;" /></p>

<p>Productivity growth, as depicted in the domestic market of the US, presents a macro-level perspective. Although individuals may have faced greater challenges during the Great Depression, thanks to the diligent work of the author of the diagram, we can compare the stock prices, which are relevant to individual people:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Producitivity-credit_equity.png" alt="Producitivity-credit_equity" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>

<p>Even when adjusted on a log-scale, the equity asset price experiences severe volatility, compared to the macro productivity measure: the GDP per capita in the market. Yet, the equity asset price clearly holds a strong relevance to the ordinary person in the economics machine. The question arises: during the Great Depression, did people suddenly forget the methods of productivity,  or did the symbols of productivity growth, these machines, suddenly revert to versions from decades prior? In analyzing this issue, we should consider another fundamental force in the economic machine: the two debt cycles.</p>

<h3 id="the-two-debt-cycles">The Two Debt Cycles</h3>

<p>Debt cycles emerge from the use of credit in economics. When we observe human society as a holistic entity, we notice that economic cycles are repetitive patterns in history.</p>

<p>To illustrate the patterns do exist, Dalio uses Monopoly as an approximation to the real-world economic machine. This is due to the design of Monopoly: in the early stage of the game, ‚Äòproperty is king‚Äô. As cash in the market decreases, the game enters the second stage where ‚Äòmoney is king‚Äô. Furthermore, with the virtual introduction of a ‚Äòbank‚Äô, which offers money with a deposit rate reward, and lends money to potential debtors, there will lead to the game to an interesting stage, where the borrowers squeeze the bank‚Äôs deposit while the debtors fail to pay back, symbolizing a debt crisis in the Monopoly game.</p>

<p>Monopoly, with its clear rules written in the reference books, serves as a simplified model. For the real-world economic machines, our task is to extract some signs and rules. Under the transaction-based measure, we can redefine prosperity and depression, then examine money and credit to understand the monetary system.</p>

<h4 id="modern-monetary-system-through-the-transaction-based-measure">Modern Monetary System Through the transaction-Based Measure</h4>

<p>The two fundamental elements in modern monetary systems are money and credit. For the sake of fiscal policy flexibility, the government shifted from the previous monetary system, which abandoned the previous commodity element, such as gold.</p>

<h5 id="money">Money</h5>

<p>In the Transaction-Based approach, money is a means to settle transactions. Compared to credit, which gradually settles payments in the future, money facilitates payment in the current timestamp. Besides, Dalio separates the total spending in the US economy into two categories in the transaction-based measure: money, which stands for the currency and reserves in existence totals about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 3 trillion, while credit amounts to about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 50 trillion, 15 times more than the money, at his writing times. This implies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Many people actually pay with credit when they settle their transaction</li>
  <li>During a debt crisis, many people may discover their payment ability is less than the obligations of credit payment.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="credit">Credit</h5>

<p>Aside from the money that printed by the central bank, individuals in the economics machine will also use capital formation to create the credit, seemingly out of thin air. 
The borrowers and the debtors, enter a contract to repay at a scheduled future time, the formed credit can be spent in the market, with no distinction from money.</p>

<p>In an ideal process, the borrowers increase their productivity at a pace faster than the conventional payback rate.
The debtor can benefit from the excess between their advanced producivity and the payback rate. And the borrowers, tend to agree on a payback rate in the contract that‚Äôs faster than the productivity growth rate of the whole market.</p>

<p>Delving deeper into the ideal process, Dalio uses a simple example about a whitewasher in his notes. But I want to retell his story, withnot losing the essence:</p>

<!-- - Dalio invite the whitewasher to paint his office, and make a paper contract. Remember, wow, the famous Dalio.
- The whitewasher actually have no adequate money to buy the materials, but he show the bank his contract. The manager of the bank, who is a friend of Dalio, lend the whitewasher the money.
- With the money, the whitewasher go to the building materials saleman, instead of buy the materials with the full money, he pay in a plan, partially money, the residual in a contract to pay in the future.
- Finally, the whitewasher finish the task in an excellent outcome, everyone in Bridgewater admire Dalio's new office. So the whitewasher get many contracts from the Bridgewater's employees. 
  Remember, he bought the materials in credit, so he can rush to the materials saleman, buy a large amount of materials to prepare the offices painting contracts in Bridgewaters.
- The story go to the end? Nope, remember the bank manager and the salesman, the bank manager can merge the credit of the whitewasher(A++ rank), into a asset package, sells in the debt market.
  And the material salemans, he find a steady buyer of the materials, which make him confident to make a better futures contract with his material manufacturers. -->

<ul>
  <li>Dalio invites the whitewasher to paint his office, and they make a paper contract. Remember, it‚Äôs the famous Dalio.</li>
  <li>The whitewasher actually has no adequate money to buy the materials, but he shows the bank his contract. The manager of the bank, who is a friend of Dalio, lends the whitewasher the money.</li>
  <li>With the money, the whitewasher goes to the building materials salesman. Instead of buying the materials with the full amount, he pays partially, with the remainder in a contract to pay in the future.</li>
  <li>Finally, the whitewasher completes the task excellently, everyone at Bridgewater admires Dalio‚Äôs new office. So, the whitewasher gets many contracts from Bridgewater‚Äôs employees.
Remember, he bought the materials on credit, so he can rush back to the materials salesman, buying a large amount of materials to prepare for the office painting contracts at Bridgewater.</li>
  <li>Is the story over? Nope, remember the bank manager and the salesman? The bank manager can consolidate the whitewasher‚Äôs credit (A rank) into an asset package, to sell in the debt market.
And the material salesman, finding a steady buyer, becomes confident enough to negotiate better futures contracts with his material manufacturers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- The money paid in the ideal process is fewer than the credit, but individual in every chain of the process are pleased with the outcome. The whitewasher get the money, the bank manager get the interest, the material salesman get the money, the material manufacturer get the money, Dalio get the new office. This is the power of credit, it helps the creation demand alleviated from the burden of the commdity or money in previous mmonetary system. The creation of credit solely depends on the confidence of borrowers and debtors in the market. It indeed accelerate the positive producivity process.
With the ideal process spreading the whole market, the market is in a self-reinforced prosperity state. -->

<p>The money paid in the ideal process is much less than the credit, but everyone in every chain of the process is pleased with the outcome. The whitewasher gets money, the bank manager earns from interest and the asset package, the material sectors get a steady order, and Dalio enjoys his new office. This is the power of credit, it alleviates the creation of demand from the burden of commodities or money in the previous monetary system. The creation of credit solely depends on the confidence of borrowers and lenders in the market. It indeed accelerates the positive productivity process.
With the ideal process permeating the whole market, the market is in a self-reinforced prosperity state.</p>

<!-- While if you notice the news about real estate deleveraging in China, you can smartly assign the respective characters in China real estate market to the characters in previous story, the abuse of the credit can incur the disasters. The heavy burdens in the private downturn the economics development. -->
<p>However, if you follow the news about real estate deleveraging in China, you can easily map the respective characters in China‚Äôs real estate market to the characters in the previous story. Abuse of credit can lead to disasters to the private sector, then hinders economic development.</p>

<p>Aside from the confidence in a win-win structure during a capital formation, another consideration for investors is liquidity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Macro-level: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 3 trillion in money, compared to about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> 50 trillion in credit</li>
  <li>On Micro-level: as depicted in the previous story, the money spent in the process is less than the credit</li>
</ul>

<p>At a certain point, when a large number of people unilaterally convert financial assets to money, the price of financial assets will crash.</p>

<h5 id="the-evolution-of-monetary-systems">The Evolution of Monetary Systems</h5>

<!-- Given the two fundemental elements, money printed by government sector and the credit formed in the market, we can introduce the reform history of monetary system in the transaction-based measure. -->

<!-- - Bart system: Gold, Silver, Cooper, such kind of precious metal, act as the settlement for transactions, where people exchange by trusting these precious metal's intrinsic value, the intrinsic value of the commdity is supported by the short-term low volatility of the supply of the commdity -->

<!-- - Commdity system: With the development of national states, the government have the central bank, while in this period, the central bank had to anchor an exchange rate of its printed money with the commdity, based on the amount of commdity stored in the insurance storage, the central bank can leverage up the supply of national money, under the expectation of they can defend the future squeeze -->

<!-- - Fiat system(Pure credit sytem): With the development of the financial system, the people, especially the government think the credit itself can act as the payment. The confidence between buyer and the seller in the market, can largely accerlate the development of the economy, since it remove the burden of limited supply of the commdity system on the rapid developing economy, which can be fueled by the flexibility of the fiscal policy of the government. 
Take US as an example, US transformed its monetary system to fiat system in two stages, the first stage occurred in the domestic market, at the period of Great Depression, FDR led the government sector to a fiat system in domestic market, 
collecting the gold from private sectors, this help the government sector has a large space to stimulate the economy.
The Bretton Wood, anchor the US dollar to an exchange rate to gold, ended in Nixon Shock, afterthen, the dollar in international market, is supported by the power of US, the country itself, and the demand of the US dollar for an exchange currency in international market. -->

<p>With the explored two foundational elements‚Äîgovernment-issued currency and market-formed credit, we can trace the evolution of monetary systems with a transaction-based perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Barter System: Initially, societies operated on a barter system, where goods and services were exchanged directly. However, the limitations of this system, especially the need for a double coincidence of wants, eventually necessitated the adoption of more universally accepted mediums of exchange.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commodity Money System: Precious metals like gold, silver, and copper gained popularity as mediums of exchange. Their intrinsic value, combined with their scarcity, ensured stability in supply. The defining characteristic of this era was the absence of a centralized banking system capable of managing money supply, with credit playing a minor role in commerce.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gold Standard: With the emergence of nation-states, central banks were established to issue currency. This currency often had a fixed exchange rate to a commodity, like gold, held in reserve. The central bank could then manage the national money supply within the constraints of their gold reserves, pledging to maintain the convertibility at the set rate. On the flip side, this system allowed central banks to expand the money supply with the expectation that they could defend their currency during potential squeeze on their gold reserves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fiat System (Pure Credit System): The advancement of financial systems led to the recognition that credit could function as money in transaction. Governments, recognizing the limitations of commodity-backed currency on economic growth, transitioned to fiat systems where currency value is based on government decree and public trust in its stability. In the U.S., the transition occurred in stages: domestically during the Great Depression under FDR, who recalled gold to expand fiscal policy leeway, and internationally with the end of the Bretton Woods system during the Nixon Shock, after which the U.S. dollar‚Äôs value was tied to the economic might of the U.S. and its demand as a reserve currency in global trade.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- The trends of the development of the monetary system, is towards:
- the government control on its money in the market, which remove the anchor of commdity, to money printed by the central bank
- Subsititute of the commdity, which provide its intrsinc value in the exchange to the credit, the confidence that the transcation can build up in the exchange -->

<p>The trajectory of monetary evolution underscores a shift towards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increased Governmental Control: Removing the commodity anchor allows governments to manage national currency more freely.</li>
  <li>Credit as a Substitute for Commodity: Trust and creditworthiness in transactions have replaced the intrinsic value commodities provided, empowering economic exchanges and growth.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-two-debts-cycles">The Two Debts Cycles</h4>

<p>With the introduction of money and credit, along with the evolution of monetary systems, we can now delve into the two debt cycles. While the long-term debt cycle is less commonly discussed in economic literature, the short-term cycle is more familiar to the general public.</p>

<!-- With the introduction of money, credit and the evolution of the monetary system, we can now explore the two debt cycles. The long term cycle is less researched in the economic field, while the short term cycle is more familiar to the public. -->

<h5 id="long-term-debt-cycle">Long-Term Debt Cycle</h5>

<!-- At the introduction of the chapter, Dalio take an upgraded Monopoly equipped with a bank to show the basic mechanism of the Monopoly. 
Take the Monopoly with bank, the long-term debt cycle refer to the process which the economics machine gradually push the debt level into an ending extent which no methods can help credit growth.
In another viewpoint, the long-term debt cycle ended with the systematic run on the bank system in a economics machine. -->

<p>At the outset of this section, Dalio uses an advanced version of the game Monopoly, which includes a bank, to illustrate the basic mechanics of economic cycles. 
In this enhanced Monopoly game, the long-term debt cycle refers to a process where the economic system gradually pushes the debt level to an unsustainable extent, eventually leading to a situation where no strategies can sustain credit growth. 
In other words, the long-term debt cycle ends with a systemic run on the banking system within an economic framework.</p>

<!-- Thus, in the case of fiat money system, the long-term debt cycle actually is rare in the federal history, the worse case of Great Recession can be another Great Depression in the fiat system.
Furthermore, to take the research sample, Dalio refer and induce some economics indexes from the Great Depression though the monetary system when Great Depression began is gold based system. -->

<p>Thus, in the context of a fiat money system, the long-term debt cycle is actually a rarity in federal history. The worst-case scenario, like the Great Recession, could potentially escalate to a crisis akin to the Great Depression in a fiat system. Furthermore, to provide empirical evidence, Dalio draws on various economic indicators from the Great Depression, although it‚Äôs important to note that the monetary system when the Great Depression started was gold-based.</p>

<p>Dalio included the long-term debt cycle top occurs in two logic indicators:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High levels of debt burden</li>
  <li>Ineffective monetary policy in stimulating credit growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the first point, excluding the exceptional periods of WWI and WWII, we observe a significant debt burden level during the Great Depression. 
To address the peak of the long-term debt cycle during this era, as part of his New Deal, FDR removed the U.S. from the gold standard domestically, expanding the government‚Äôs fiscal policy capabilities. 
The Roosevelt New Deal, a combination of various fiscal policies, successfully reversed the reinforcing downturn trend of the federal system. 
Focusing on the four periods during President FDR‚Äôs tenure, an analysis of the debt-to-GDP ratio reveals some interesting points:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/debt_ratio_to_gdp.png" alt="debt_ratio_to_gdp" style="zoom:25%;" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the Roosevelt New Deal, there‚Äôs a noticeable increase in local debt, likely attributable to public works projects. 
These projects provided employment opportunities and elevated the U.S. infrastructure level. 
Iconic constructions of the era like the Hoover Dam, are still operational today.</li>
  <li>Regarding the impact of World War II, particularly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, there was a shift from local and state debts to federal debts. 
This restructuring of federal debt, facilitated by the Public Debt Act of 1941, was part of a broader wartime strategy that centralized fiscal authority and economic planning at the federal level to mobilize resources for World War II. 
Following WWII, the world transitioned to the Bretton Woods system, where the centralization of fiscal power concerning debt remained with the federal government until today.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we delve into the macro-level analysis of high debt burdens, we encounter the second critical issue: the diminishing effectiveness of monetary policy in stimulating credit growth.</p>

<p>This ineffectiveness often stems from a decades-long cumulative leveraging process. To illustrate, consider the concept of a ‚Äòdebt gap‚Äô in the context of household debt. The household sector is fundamental to the economic machine at the domestic level, underpinning the government, financial, and corporate sectors. When households are stretched to their financial limits‚Äîa situation that can be quantified as a ‚Äòdebt service gap‚Äô‚Äîthe closer the total household debt level (both the aggregate amount and annual service costs) comes to this gap, the less effective monetary policy is at stimulating further credit growth.</p>

<p>To depict this phenomenon, Dalio presents a graph on the household debt service to disposable income ratio.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/US_Household_Debt_Service_to_Income.png" alt="US_Household_Debt_Service_to_Income" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As the Roaring Twenties concluded, U.S. household debt service was approximately 10% of disposable income, with much of the credit creation concentrated in the stock market. However, between the stock market crash and the robust implementation of the Roosevelt New Deal, the household debt service level did not immediately drop; rather, it increased due to a reduction in income levels. Mere statistics can‚Äôt fully express the real-life tragedies of that period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gap persists even within a fiat monetary system. However, thanks to the system‚Äôs flexibility, the government can elevate the gap or employ adaptive fiscal policies to avert crisis-level defaults within the economic machine.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At the onset of the Great Recession, the household debt service level was again at a critical gap, based on conditions at the time. Yet, with the fiat system and untypical fiscal policies like Quantitative Easing (QE), this level was managed, helping to prevent an economic collapse akin to the Great Depression.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/Household_debt_to_GDP_income.png" alt="Household_debt_to_GDP_income" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Rhodium Group‚Äôs research on household debt levels indicates that in both developed countries, like the U.S., and developing ones, such as China, when the ratio of Household Debt to Household Disposable Income reaches a relatively high level‚Äîaround 120%‚Äîthe household sector shows signs of strain, becoming increasingly resistant to additional debt. Consequently, stimulation policies, such as those targeting the real estate market, lose their effectiveness.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôs easier to understand that GDP is a macro-level metric, while household disposable income is a micro-level indicator, which more acutely reflects the economic pressures on individuals.</p>

<p>In discussing the indicators that signal the peak of a long-term debt crisis, Dalio underscores the underestimated perils of scenarios marked by financial asset bubbles and low inflation‚Äîconditions that can cause a bank run within the economic system. Historical events such as the Great Depression, Japan‚Äôs Asset Price Bubble, and the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis illustrate the catastrophic potential of financial asset crises on the entire economic machine. Dalio identifies a critical juncture for these crises: the point at which fiscal policy has no room to maneuver, characterized by interest rates approaching 0%. Given the nature of financial assets, which are often leveraged with minimal money and substantial credit, the consequences of a run in such a context can be devastating.</p>

<p>At the catastrophic turning point of the long-term debt cycle, four fundamental forces intertwine and dominate the economic machine before it can alleviate its debt burden and reenter a healthier state:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Debt reduction through defaults or restructuring</li>
  <li>Austerity measures</li>
  <li>Wealth redistribution</li>
  <li>Debt monetization</li>
</ul>

<p>Depressions represent the contraction phase of the deleveraging process, with debt reduction‚Äîespecially defaults‚Äîand austerity measures taking precedence. During this contraction phase, individual income levels inevitably fall as all sectors adopt austerity measures to protect their property. Additionally, the shrinkage of net worth can be explained by the idea of borrower creditworthiness, which hinges on two factors: their disposable incomes and their net worth. Similar to the ascent of the fiat monetary system, both disposable incomes and net worth face a downward spiral, causing the creditworthiness of borrowers to decline.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/US_Household_debt_to_Net_Worth.png" alt="US_Household_debt_to_Net_Worth" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>

<p>Coupled with the Household Debt to Disposable Income ratio, the contraction phase after a long-term debt cycle peak reveals an increase in individual debt levels during the depression stage. The decline in income and net worth occurs more rapidly than the pace at which debts are defaulted on. Again, mere statistics cannot fully convey the grim reality of those times. As borrowers‚Äô creditworthiness declines, debtors tend to retract funds, which, under the properties of a fiat money system, is problematic because actual money in circulation is much less abundant than credit. It‚Äôs not a matter of morality, but debtors‚Äô fear of defaults indeed cause a severe cash flow crisis within the economic machine.</p>

<p>During this depression stage, the private sector often lie down, adopting austerity measures. Conversely, a responsible government sector will implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies to bolster market spending. Dalio outlines three government actions during such times:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initiatives to encourage credit creation</li>
  <li>Relaxation of regulations compelling debtors to service their debts</li>
  <li>Money printing and spending on goods, services, and financial assets</li>
</ul>

<p>The figures represent easing credit creation, money printing, and spending, respectively. Regulations on debt servicing are not within the purview of the Federal Reserve and are challenging to quantify.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2023-10-23-How-the-Economics-Machine-Works-Notes/government_fiscal_policy_in_depression.png" alt="government_fiscal_policy_in_depression" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>

<p>When these three anomalies‚Äîcredit easing, increased government spending, and relaxed debt servicing regulations‚Äîoccur simultaneously, it‚Äôs a clear sign that the economic machine is damped in a depression. Because these expansionary measures originate from the government sector, the improvement in the private sector‚Äôs debt level will lag behind. Moreover, while the analysis of debtors is rooted in their psychology, statistical data on populations reveal that until the private sector‚Äôs debt levels decrease to a sustainable level, the contraction will persist. During this stage, the will of most in private sectors, inevitably compel the government to intervene, either through increased fiscal budget or by the central bank monetizing the debt. Delving into the monetization of the debt, which central bank inject money into the economy includes purchasing government securities and private assets such as corporate securities, equities, and other financial instruments. The goal of these actions is to mitigate the contraction of credit, by an exceedingly increase money in economics machine.</p>

<p>Wealth redistribution often comes into play as governments use taxation as a tool to balance budgets and address income inequality. Governments may impose taxes on the wealthy through various means, such as income and consumption taxes. While these taxes can bolster government revenues, they may also lead to a decrease in economic activity. This is because as the government draws on cash flows, it can inadvertently harm the normal functioning of businesses, prompting the wealthy to become more defensive and protective of their assets. Thus, an increase in government revenue can coincide with a direct loss in industries predominantly owned by wealthier individuals.</p>

<p>From global perspective to consider wealth redistribution, wealthy individuals and corporations might attempt to safeguard their assets by converting them into other currencies or investing abroad if they perceive a threat from increased taxation or less favorable fiscal policies. This can lead to capital flight, which poses a significant risk to the foreign exchange stability of the country‚Äôs economy. Countries with current account deficits are especially susceptible to such movements of capital, often prompting their central banks to print more money, which can devalue the currency. A depreciating currency may, in turn, trigger a rush towards more stable foreign currencies or inflation-hedge assets. Ultimately, the capital formation within the domestic market may diminish, outweighing the gains from taxes or hedging activities.</p>

<!-- On summarizing the long term debt cycle, the research point is on the deleveraging process, on the contraction process of deleveraging process, the austerity and debt reduction will dominate, this stage lasts for about two or three years. Then the economics machine will step into a slow process to recover, in which the government should apply fiscal policy to keep the nominal interest rates under the nominal growth to relieve the debt burden. -->

<p>In summarizing the long-term debt cycle, a key area of study is the deleveraging process. During the contraction phase of deleveraging, austerity measures and debt reduction typically take precedence. This stage can last around two to three years before the economy begins its slow journey to recovery. At this point, it‚Äôs crucial for the government to implement fiscal policies designed to maintain nominal interest rates below the rate of nominal growth. Such policies aim to alleviate the overall debt burden, fostering a more sustainable economic environment.</p>

<p>The short-term debt cycle, also known as the business cycle, is primarily influenced by the monetary policies of central banks. These policies typically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tighten under certain conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>High inflation

<p>As shown in the figure, the short-term debt cycle exhibits a more periodic nature compared to the longer-term cycle. Dalio divides the short-term debt cycle into six phases‚Äîfour in expansion and two in recession:</p>

<!-- * the "early-cycle"(which typically lasts about five or six quarters): as the subsequent phase to the end of contraction phase of the previous cycle. In this phase, economics enjoys a high growth (in excess of 4%), with characters: -->
<ul>
  <li>The ‚ÄúEarly-Cycle‚Äù (lasting about five or six quarters): Following the contraction phase of the previous cycle, this phase typically features:
    <ul>
      <li>High growth (over 4%).</li>
      <li>Kow inflation</li>
      <li>fast credit growth</li>
      <li>growth in comsumpution, particular the demands for interest rate sensitive items</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the ‚Äúmid-cycle‚Äù(which lasts an average of three or four quarters): The growth in previous slows substantially(i.e., to around 2%):
    <ul>
      <li>inflation remain lows</li>
      <li>slower growth in consumption</li>
      <li>the rate of inventory accumlation declines</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the ‚Äúlate-cycle‚Äú(which typically begins about two and a half years into expansion, depending on how much slack existed in the economy at the last recession‚Äôs trough): All growth will gradual peak in this stage, economic growth picks up to a moderate pace (i.e., around 3.5-4%)
    <ul>
      <li>credit and demand growth still strong, while capacity constraint emerge, due to the inventory acculation declines</li>
      <li>trending higher inflation</li>
      <li>interest rate start to rise</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the ‚Äútightening phase‚Äù(the top of the expansion stage):
    <ul>
      <li>the inflation problem prompt central bank apply fiscal policy</li>
      <li>interest rate higher and contracted money supply</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the early part of the recession:
    <ul>
      <li>the economics contracts</li>
      <li>slack return(measured iby GDP gap, capacity utilization and the unemployment rate)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>the late part of the recession:
    <ul>
      <li>the economics still downturn, with controlled inflation</li>
      <li>the interest rate decline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While Dalio also emphasis there are some flexibility in the analysis structure of short-term debt cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the sequences of phases depend on some signal events, rather than simple timeline</li>
  <li>the central bank fiscal policy style should take into consideration. The time varies with an aggressive or a conservative central bank</li>
  <li>some structural factors influence should appended, such as China‚Äôs entry into the world economy, wars and natural disasters</li>
</ul>
